# hello-world
This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow
This is not the first time I am using GitHub but this is the first time I am learning it. There is a different between using it and actually learning it. This time I wanna nail it down and become an expert in using GitHub. It not going to be easy but I am ready to learn  it.
